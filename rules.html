<h1>Rules</h1>
<br><p>This is the rule page, in which you can find who counts as a viable member of the list, what the qualifications are for a level to be placed, and what is required in a viable completion. If some of these rules seem harsh, it's because this is for a friend group and we want it to stay that way.</p>
<br><h1>Member viability</h1>
<br><p>To be a viable member (aka to be able to submit levels/completions and to allow levels themed around YOU to be placed), you need to be part of the friend group server named <b><i>the couch infinity unleashed</b></i> AND you must have a Geometry Dash account (if I don't know your username, send it in the <b><i>couch-list-gd-usernames</i></b> channel and I'll notice it almost instantly). All eligible members are shown on the <a href="completions.html">members/completions</a> page.</p>
<br><h1>Completion viability</h1>
<br><p>To have a completion accepted, you must have a completion that follows these rules:</p><br><ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>The completionist must be part of the friend group</li>
	<li>The completion must be legitimate (duh)</li>
	<li>A screenshot of the level complete screen as well as the level page (post-completion) must be provided</li>
	<li>A cheat indicator must be visible at all times (exempt from this rule if you play vanilla GD)</li>
	<li>A completion video is optional but highly recommended</li>
</ul>
<br><p>If you don't follow these rules, your record will get <b>DENIED.</b></p>
<br><h1>Level submission viability</h1>
<br><p>To have a level accepted and placed on the list, you must have the level follow these rules:</p><br><ul style="padding-left: 60px;">
	<li>The creator, verifier and publisher must all be part of the friend group</li>
	<li>The verification must be legitimate (duh)</li>
	<li>The level must be listed on the servers (no unlisted levels)</li>
	<li>The level must be at least 30 seconds long</li>
	<li>The level must be harder than Can't Let Go (aka the hardest 1.0 RobTop level)</li>
	<li>The level must have at least a minor role in the Discord server or must be dedicated to the Discord server or one of its eligible members in <a href="completions.html">members/completions.</a></li>
	<li>The level will get a botted showcase displayed until someone beats it with a verification video</li>
</ul>
<br><p>If your level doesn't follow these rules, your level will get <b>DENIED,</b> however you are allowed to resubmit it if you fix the level.</p>
<br><h1>Theming</h1>
<br><p>The color scheme that you must use for every level themed around the list itself consists of the hex codes <i>#BBBBFF, #8888FF </i>and<i> #4444FF</i> (and of course full black/full white). Additionally, a level themed around the list itself must include :3/:D (or any other colon ASCII emoji)</p>
